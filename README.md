# UK-house-prices
 
This project aims to predict the average sales volume of UK house prices in future years using linear regression machine learning algorithms. Two main models were implemented and evaluated: one utilizing time lagged variables, and the other incorporating monthly changes and sales volume. The performance of these models was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their effectiveness was further evaluated by examining residual plots on both the training and testing datasets. This allowed for an assessment of how well the linear regression extrapolated to unseen data.
